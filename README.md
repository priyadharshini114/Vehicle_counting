# Vehicle_counting
This repository contains a Python script that utilizes the YOLOv8 object detection model and OpenCV to count objects crossing predefined lines in a video. The script processes a video file, tracks objects, and counts the number of times they cross specified lines, outputting the results to a new video file.
